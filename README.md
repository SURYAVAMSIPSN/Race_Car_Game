# Race_Car_Game
An implementation of the Pygame Car Race Tutorial series offered by Sentdex 
(Source: https://pythonprogramming.net/pygame-python-3-part-1-intro/) # This is a Good Tutorial series. 

This is game is about moving a car in the upwards direction. Obstacles (Boxes) descend down and come in the way of the car. The player 
needs to control using arrow keys left and right to dodge away from the Boxes. As each box passes, the next box arrives at a greater 
speed and greater width, in order to make it more challenging. For each dodge, the score increases, and the player can try to reach a high 
score as much as possible! 

- The file A_bit_Racey.py contains the main code. Run it in a command window (with the other files in the same directory) to play the game. 
- The file my_car.png is the image of the main character of the game. (You can make another of your own using Paint or any image and 
import it)
- The file setup.py creates a .exe excecutable, if you want to share it with people who don't have python with them. 
In command window, type "python setup.py build" to execute. Results can be seen in a newly created "build" folder

WARNING! The setup.py build command successfully creates an exe file, but the size is about 750 MB. To reduce size, delete certain 
unnecessary libraries inside the build folder. 

HAVE FUN, AND FEEL FREE TO PUT YOUR CREATIVITY INTO IMPROVING THIS FURTHER!
